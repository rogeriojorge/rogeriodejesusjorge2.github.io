I am learning everyday and as a new project comes up I will soon post it here.\r\nI am a strong advocate of open source and I keep private repositories only for unfinished/not personal codes (despite the fact that I never consider a code finished \"per se\").\r\n\r\nWell, here are my ## recent projects\r\n\r\n### Ray Tracing Solver\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Rogeriodejesusjorge/RTS\r\n\r\nSoftware: Mathematica\r\nUses a Monte Carlo and a 2nd order method to solve ray equations through an Hamiltonian formalism.\r\n\r\n### General Relativistic Vorticity Solver\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Rogeriodejesusjorge/grvs\r\n\r\nSoftware: Mathematica\r\nSolving General Relativistic geodesic equations for a general space-time metric, finds the Lorentz factor as a functino of the radius and computes the magnetic field seed.\r\n\r\n### N-Particle with Lorentz Force\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Rogeriodejesusjorge/Matlab-Lorentz-Solver\r\n\r\nSoftware: Matlab\r\nFor user input electric and magnetic fields, it solves the Lorentz force equation for a limited amount of specified time steps and outputs to a video. All particles are initialized with a given temperature (Gaussian distribution).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
